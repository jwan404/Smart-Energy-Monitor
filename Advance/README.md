# Advance Repository Structure

This is the advance structure for your project repository, which mimics the structure of a real-world Git project.

If you are not confident enough with Git/GitHub yet and would like a simpler repository structure, you may choose to use the [basic structure](../Basic/).

> **Note**  
> - The industry judges will have a look at your repo if you are among the top teams.
> - Familiarity with branches and pull requests is *expected pre-requisite knowledge* in `COMPSYS 302`.
> - EEE students will also continue to use GitHub in `ELECTENG 311`, and possibly in the industry even as a hardware design engineer.

## Usage

Refer to [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a suggested possible workflow using this structure.
